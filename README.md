DDNet-insta based on DDRaceNetwork, a Teeworlds mod. See the [website](https://ddnet.tw) for more information.

For build instructions visit the [ddnet repo](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet).

---

A ddnet based pvp mod. With the focus on correct 0.6 and 0.7 support and staying close to and up to date with ddnet.
While being highly configurable and feature rich.

Implementing most of the relevant pvp gametypes: gctf, ictf, gdm, idm, gtdm, itdm, zCatch, bolofng, solofng, boomfng, fng


Planned gametypes are: ctf, dm

# Project name and scope

The name **ddnet-insta** is short for DummyDragRaceNetwork Instagib. Because it started out as a ddnet based modification with the
focus on gCTF with the possible future scope for also other instagib (one shot kills) gametypes such as iCTF, zCatch and fng.
But it now has expanded to support also damage based gameplay such as teeworlds vanilla CTF and DM. So currently it aims to support
any kind of round based pvp gametype that can be implemented without causing too much maintenance cost.


NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:


It also tries to be extendable and fork friendly. If you want to build a pvp gamemode with score points and rounds.
This code base should get you started quite easily. Just create a new folder for your gamemode. After wiring it up in
[gamecontext](https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/blob/ba38c11ccf46e888786c90c7dc0f09503be19a49/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L4018-L4019)
and [cmakelist](https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/blob/ba38c11ccf46e888786c90c7dc0f09503be19a49/CMakeLists.txt#L2751-L2752)
you should be able to build almost any gametype without ever having to edit code outside
of your gamemode directory. Just look at the existing gamemodes for examples. A simple mode to look at would be
[vanilla deathmatch](https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/tree/ba38c11ccf46e888786c90c7dc0f09503be19a49/src/game/server/gamemodes/vanilla/dm).
Adding your own stats columns and rank/top commands can be done in a few lines of code without writing any SQL.

# Features

## Stats tracked in sql database

Every players kills, deaths, wins and more statistics are persisted in a database.
There are no accounts. The stats are tacked on the players names. What exactly is tracked
depends on the ``sv_gametype``. But here are some chat commands that work in any gamemode:

- ``/stats`` Shows the current round stats. Takes a player name as optional argument.
- ``/statsall`` Shows the all time stats. Takes a player name as optional argument.
- ``/top5kills`` Shows the all time top 5 players by amount of kills. Takes an offset as optional argument ``/top5kills 5`` to see rank 5 till 10 for example.
- ``/rank_kills`` Show the all time rank of a players kills compared to others. Takes a player name as optional argument.
- ``/rank`` to list all rank commands for the current gametype
- ``/top`` to list all top commands for the current gametype

## Checkbox votes

If a vote is added starting with a ``[ ]`` in the display name. It will be used as a checkbox.
If the underlying config is currently set that checkbox will be ticked and users see ``[x]`` in the vote menu.
This feature is optional and if you do not put any  ``[ ]`` in your config it will not be using any checkboxes.
It is only applied for ddnet-insta settings not for all ddnet configs.
It is recommended to set ``sv_vote_checkboxes 0`` at the start of your autoexec and ``sv_vote_checkboxes 1``
at the end so it does not update all votes for every setting it loads.

![checkbox votes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet-insta/images/c6c3e871a844fa06b460b8be61ba0ff01d0a82f6/checkbox_votes.png)

## Unstack chat for ddnet clients

Newer DDNet clients do not show duplicated messages multiple times. This is not always wanted when using call binds for team communication during pvp games. So there is ``sv_unstack_chat`` to revert that ddnet feature and ensure every message is sent properly in chat.

![unstack_chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet-insta/images/3c437acdea599788fb245518e9c25de7c0e63795/unstack_chat.png)

## 0.6 and 0.7 support including ready change

ddnet-insta uses the 0.6/0.7 server side version bridge from ddnet. So all gametypes are playable by latest teeworlds clients and ddnet clients at the same time.

In 0.7 there was a ready change added which allows users to pause the game. It only continues when everyone presses the ready bind.
This feature is now also possible for 0.6 clients using the /pause chat command. This feature should be turned off on public servers ``sv_player_ready_mode 0`` because it will be used by trolls.

![pause game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet-insta/images/1a2d10c893605d704aeea8320cf0e65f8e0c2aa3/ready_change.png)

## 0.7 dead players in zCatch

In 0.6 dead players join the spectators team in the zCatch gamemode.

![zCatch 0.6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet-insta/images/master/zCatch_teetime_06.png)

In 0.7 they are marked as dead players and are separate from spectators.

![zCatch 0.7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet-insta/images/master/zCatch_teetime_07.png)

## Allow spectator votes for 0.7

The official teeworlds 0.7 client does block voting on the client side for spectators.
To make `sv_spectator_votes` portable and fair for both 0.6 and 0.7 players there is an option to allow
0.7 clients to vote as spectators. It is a bit hacky so it is hidden behind then config `sv_spectator_votes_sixup 1`
when that is set it will make the 0.7 clients believe they are in game and unlock the call vote menu.
But this also means that to join the game the users have to press the "spectate" button.

## Lots of little fun opt in features

By default ddnet-insta tries to be ready to be used in competetive games. Being as close to prior implementations
of the gametypes as possible. With that being said there are lots of opt in configurations to customize the gameplay.


Check the [Configs](#Configs) section for a complete list. One of the highlights would be dropping the flag in CTF
gametypes.

![drop flags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet-insta/images/master/drop_flag.gif)

Most of the settings that affect the gameplay can be shown to the user with `sv_show_settings_motd`
so they know what is going on:

![settings motd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet-insta/images/master/settings_motd.png)

## Gametype support

Make sure to also `reload` or switch the map when changing the gametype.

# Chat commands

Most ddnet slash chat commands were inherited and are still functional.

ddnet-insta then added a bunch of own slash chat commands and also bang (!) chat commands

+ `!ready` `!pause` `/pause` `/ready` to pause the game. Needs `sv_player_ready_mode 1` and 0.7 clients can also send the 0.7 ready change message
+ `!shuffle` `/shuffle` call vote to shuffle teams
+ `!swap` `/swap` call vote to swap teams
+ `!swap_random` `/swap_random` call vote to swap teams to random sides
+ `!settings` show current game settings in the message of the day. It will show if spray protection is on or off and similar game relevant settings.
+ `!1v1` `!2v2` `!v1` `!v2` `!1on1` ... call vote to change in game slots
+ `!restart ?(seconds)` call vote to restart game with optional parameter of warmup seconds (default: 10)
+ `/drop flag` if it is a CTF gametype the flagger can drop the flag without dieing if either `sv_drop_flag_on_selfkill` or `sv_drop_flag_on_vote` is set
+ `/rank` Lists available rank commands
+ `/top5` Lists available top commands
+ `/top` Lists available top commands
+ `/stats` Shows the current round stats of player name (your stats by default)
+ `/statsall` Shows the all time stats of player name (your stats by default)
+ `/stats_all` Shows the all time stats of player name (your stats by default)
+ `/points` Shows the all time points rank of player name (your stats by default)
+ `/rank_points` Shows the all time points rank of player name (your stats by default)
+ `/rank_kills` Shows the all time kills rank of player name (your stats by default)
+ `/top5kills` Shows the all time best ranks by kills
+ `/rank_flags` Shows the all time flag time rank of player name (your stats by default)
+ `/top5flags` Shows the all time best ranks by flag time
+ `/top5caps` Shows the all time best ranks by amount of flag captures
+ `/rank_caps` Shows the all time flag capture rank of player name (your stats by default)

# Publish round stats

At the end of every round the stats about every players score can be published to discord (and other destinations).

The following configs determine which format the stats will be represented in.

+ `sv_round_stats_format_discord` 0=csv 1=psv 2=ascii table 3=markdown table 4=json
+ `sv_round_stats_format_http` 0=csv 1=psv 2=ascii table 3=markdown table 4=json
+ `sv_round_stats_format_file` 0=csv 1=psv 2=ascii table 3=markdown table 4=json

And these configs determin where the stats will be sent to.

+ `sv_round_stats_discord_webhook` Will do a discord webhook POST request to that url. The url has to look like this: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1232962289217568799/8i_a89XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
  If you don't know how to setup a discord webhook, don't worry its quite simple. You need to have admin access to a discord server and then you can follow this [1 minute youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKksxz2Gdnc).
+ `sv_round_stats_http_endpoint` It will do a http POST request to that url with the round stats as payload. You can set this to your custom api endpoint that collect stats. Example: `https://api.zillyhuhn.com/insta/round_stats`
+ `sv_round_stats_output_file` It will write the round stats to a file located at that path. You could then read that file with another tool or expose it with an http server.
  It can be a relaltive path then it uses your storage.cfg location. Or a absolute path if it starts with a slash. The file will be overwritten on every round end.
  To avoid that you can use the `%t` placeholder in the filename and it will expand to a timestamp to avoid file name collisions.
  Example values: `stats.json`, `/tmp/round_stats_%t.csv`

## csv - comma separated values (format 0)

The first two rows are special. The first is a csv header.
The second one is the red and blue team score.
After that each row is two players each. Red player first and blue player second.
If player names include commas their name will be quoted (see the example player `foo,bar`).
So this is how the result of a 2x2 could look like:

```
red_name, red_score, blue_name, blue_score
red, 24, blue, 3
"foo,bar", 15, (1)ChillerDrago, 2
ChillerDragon, 0, ChillerDragon.*, 1
```
