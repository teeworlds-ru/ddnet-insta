# Configs

ddnet-insta inherited all configs from ddnet. So make sure to also check ddnet's documentation.
The following ddnet configs are highly recommended to set in ddnet-insta to get the best pvp
experience.

```
# autoexec_server.cfg

sv_tune_reset 0
sv_destroy_bullets_on_death 0
sv_destroy_lasers_on_death 0
sv_no_weak_hook 1
sv_vote_veto_time 0
conn_timeout 10
conn_timeout_protection 5
```

ddnet also has something called a reset file. Which is a special config.
By default it is loaded from reset.cfg and it can be set to a custom location
using the config ``sv_reset_file``


In this **reset.cfg** it is recommended to set the following configs
to get a more classic pvp experience.

```
# reset.cfg

sv_team 0
sv_old_laser 1 # wallshot should not collide with own tee
tune laser_bounce_num 1
```
