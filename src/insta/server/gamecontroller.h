		Function: OnCharacterTakeDamage
			this function was added in ddnet-insta and is a non standard controller method.
			neither ddnet nor teeworlds have this

			WARNING: if you implement a pvp mode and inherit from base pvp this method should
				 ideally not be overridden.
				 Have a look in base_pvp.cpp at `CGameControllerBasePvp::OnCharacterTakeDamage()`
				 how it is implemented.
				 If you want to track any kind of hit use `OnAnyDamage()` instead.
				 If you want to disable damage in some situations use `SkipDamage()` instead.
				 If you want to implement your own damage logic use `OnAppliedDamage()`.
				 Only if you really need something custom you should use
				 `OnCharacterTakeDamage()` but then it should call all the same methods
				 as the base pvp version or some features will break.

		Arguments:
			Force - Reference to force. Set this vector and it will be applied to the target characters velocity
			Dmg - Input and outoput damage that was applied. You can read and write it.
			From - Client Id of the player who dealt the damage
			Weapon - Weapon id that was causing the damage see the WEAPON_* enums
			Character - Character that was damaged

		Returns:
			return true to skip ddnet CCharacter::TakeDamage() behavior
			which is applying the force and moving the damaged tee
			it also sets the happy eyes if the Dmg is not zero

		Function: OnKill
			This method is called when one player kills another (no selfkills or team kills).
			It should be called before the victims character is marked as dead.
			It is similar to OnCharacterTakeDamage() and OnCharacterDeath()
			and is here to stadardize the concept of what a kill is across game types.

			Some modes have kills triggered by death and some triggered by damage.
			Some by both and some by only one of these.

			For example in fng the OnCharacterTakeDamage() is called on laser hit which is never a
			kill only a freeze.
			The real kill comes from a death triggered by the world.

			Modes like block and fly work similar to fng.

			And then there is modes like color catch where shots do not kill a tee in the world
			but conceptually a hit counts as a kill.

			So kill here conceptually stands for whatever the current gametype interprets as
			one player killing another player.

			The base implementation only sets the killers eye emote to happy.
			You can add additional things in here that you want to happen on kill.

		Arguments:
			pVictim - Player that died. Its character should be still alive but might die in this tick (depending on the gametype)
			pKiller - Player that causes the kill. Will never be nullptr. We need a killer for it to count as a kill.
				  Which means this method is not called if the killer left the game and his projectile hits after that.
